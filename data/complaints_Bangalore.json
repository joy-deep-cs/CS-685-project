There's a very strong rotting smell, it appears that it could be because of an array of factories that is amongst our residential area of Dr Shivaramakaranth Nagar. We suspect that it could be because of huge wet waste dumps in and around the area. I have notified the PCB (pollution control board) and BBMP to investigate. To better increase the chance of find the root cause, I've the attached a map of the residents that primarily get this smell. It is particular.\u00a0\nThis smell has been persistent and getting stronger by the day, the kids in the house are suffering from itchiness in the throat by breathing this foul air and since we're not aware of the health hazards of this toxic smell, we want your help to avoid any harm caused by this. We request officials of the pollution control board and BBMP to please come and inspect the location. Please help the taxpaying and law-abiding citizens of Winnfield garden.
