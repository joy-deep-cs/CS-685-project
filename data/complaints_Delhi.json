{"id": 592791, "description": "This is regarding the New Vasant Kunj Mehrauli Link Road just in front of Smriti Van. Few years back when the road was built, it was nice and well maintained. As the years passed, the road's condition has become pathetic. It has a lot of potholes which are very dangerous for vehicles and during rains, it gets flooded with water. People can't even walk on this road during monsoons. Also out of nowhere some random people have started throwing garbage on this road and that is huge in number and quantity. Almost eighty percent of the road is filled with garbage. The road stinks a lot and due to the dirtiness there is a possibility of so many diseases being spread near the neighbourhood. The street lights used to work but now they are of no use as they don't work at all. I thought that during elections or after elections the road will be repaired but I think the government and the authorities just don't care about this situation. I have complained so many times about this road in the past but nobody has taken a permanent step to fix this problem.
